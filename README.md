# Welcome to the BULLSEYE GAME!


## Overview

The Bullseye Game is a browser-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project was from a FreeCodeCamp course, and it features custom sprite images designed for this game.

In this game, simple trigonometry and vector mathematics are used for collision detection to simulate interactions between objects. Additionally, a very basic AI algorithm is implemented to give creatures lifelike movements as they approach the player.

## Playing the game:

In the Bullseye Game, you control the blue character and are tasked with protecting eggs from random incoming monsters that appear from the RIGHT side of the screen.

Safe Zone: The Safe Forest at the top of the screen is where hatchlings and eggs are safe. Yellow sparks signify a successful save, earning you one point. Red sparks indicate a hatchling has been eaten.

Hatching Time: Eggs hatch after 9 seconds, making the hatchlings vulnerable to monsters.


Objectives:

* Protect the eggs and push them to the Safe Forest.

* Save / Score 30 hatchlings to win.

* The game ends once you score 30 Hatchings, but you win ONLY if 6 or less hatchings were eaten.

* To restart the game at any time, press r on your keyboard.
