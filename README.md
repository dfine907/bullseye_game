## Welcome to the BULLSEYE GAME!

# Overview
The Bullseye Game is a browser-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project was from a FreeCodeCamp course, and it features custom sprite images designed for this game.

In this game, simple trigonometry and vector mathematics are used for collision detection to simulate interactions between objects. Additionally, a basic AI algorithm is implemented to give creatures lifelike movements as they approach the player character through recursion.
